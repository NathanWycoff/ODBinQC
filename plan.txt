We're going to compare a couple of methods for monitoring binary valued quality characteristics with legitimate batch to batch variation.

We're going to make comparisions based on ARL profile.

In order for the comparisons to be fair, the methods must have comparable in-control ARL. This can be achieved by tuning parameters for each method. I think im goping to target an ARL of 100.

That there is no single way to define "out-of-controlness" in this situation is a difficulty. I suggest fixing 3 variance levels, "low", "medium", "high", and then calculating ARL for many mean shifts within each. Hopefully, alpha and beta may be uniquely determined from a given variance and mean.
