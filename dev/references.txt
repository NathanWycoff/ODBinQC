-- A beta control chart is great, but it's constant for different n, which is wrong.
Beta control charts for monitoring fraction data

-- Dang, someone has done a beta-binomial control chart (seems to be in portuguese)
BAYESIAN CONTROL CHARTS FOR ATTRIBUTES AND THE LARGE SUBGROUP SIZE IN p CHART

Seem to want to do fully bayesian inference using the chart, and do not estimate alpha, beta but elicit prior info by picking a target interval

-- Oh somebody did it in Korean too:

Development of a p Control Chart for Overdispersed Process with Beta-Binomial Model

They recommend estimating using either ML or MoM, both of which would suffer from inflated variance estiamtes if there is a sustained mean shift.
they have a cool reparameterization for the beta-binomial that is much more intuitive than the standard one.

-- do RE on an example

-- a sim study on the same topic, doesn't include RE's tho
Outlier Detection for Healthcare Quality Monitoring – A Comparison of Four Approaches to Over-Dispersed Proportions

-- Read this eventually, it seems to be hard to get my hands on:
Statistical process control charts for attribute data involving very large sample sizes: a review of problems and solutions

-- These guys include the binomial dist as a special case, but it is no longer overdispersed at that point.
A generalized statistical control chart for over- or under-dispersed data

-- These guys evaluated the Laney chart against the p-chart, but don
